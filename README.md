# Machine Learning Implementations

## Overview

**Machine_Learning** is a repository containing implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. This repository is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the underlying mechanisms of these algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aamir-M-Khan/Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Machine_Learning
    ```

## Usage

You can run each algorithm's implementation as a standalone Python script. For example, to run the KNN implementation:
```bash
python KNN_from_scratch.py
